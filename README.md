##[Q.1] - LIBRARY INFORMATION SYSTEM[LIS]
## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
*A system should present all the necessary details about the book.
*The system should ask users for their username and password when they want to issue a book. The system checks whether submitted data is accurate, such as whether a password was properly entered or whether a username was entered.
*A system should allow users to look for books in the library using criteria like the title, author, release date, etc. in accordance with their needs.
*The system assigns a unique identifying number to each items. It should also assign each member a special identification number.
*Users should be able to use the system to reserve a specific item they desire from anywhere by providing their identification number.
*Only if the user is a member of the system should the LIS system enable the user to borrow a book or return it if it has already been borrowed. Once a librarian confirms a user's request to borrow a book, the user is then able to borrow it.
*If a book has already been borrowed by another user, the system should notify the user that the book has already been borrowed by others rather than giving the user the option to borrow it.
*The system should provide the user with the list of books they now have out to borrow, books they have previously borrowed, the dates they were borrowed and returned, and additional information they want.
*The librarian should be able to add new records to the database when a new book is purchased and remove records whenever a book is taken off the shelf using a system.
*When the books are returned, the system should calculate the fee for the overdue books and notify the user and librarian of the overdue books.
*The system should offer a better search option for the books that are currently in stock.
